# Emotion-Based-Music-Recommender
This is a simple web-based project that detects human emotions in real-time using a Teachable Machine model and recommends music accordingly. It captures four types of emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, and Neutral, and plays suitable songs to match your mood.

🔧 How It Works
Uses a custom-trained Teachable Machine model (TensorFlow.js) to detect facial expressions.
